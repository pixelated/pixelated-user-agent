Feature: Attachments
  As a user of Pixelated
  I want to download attachments of mails I received
  So that my peers are able to send me any kind of content, not just text

  Scenario: User opens a mail attachment
    Given I have a mail with an attachment in my inbox
    When I open the first mail in the 'inbox'
    Then I see the mail has an attachment
    #When I open click on the first attachment
    #Then the browser downloaded a file

  Scenario: User uploads a mail attachment
    When I compose a message with
      | subject          | body                                        |
      | Pixelated rocks! | You should definitely use it. Cheers, User. |
      And for the 'To' field I enter 'pixelated@friends.org'
    And I find an attachment icon
    When I try to upload a file bigger than 1MB
    Then I see an upload error message
    When I dismiss the error message
    Then It should not show the error message anymore
    When I upload a valid file
    And remove the file
    Then I should not see it attached
    When I upload a valid file
    And I send it
    When I select the tag 'sent'
    And I open the first mail in the mail list
    Then I see the mail has an attachment

Feature: sign up, login and logout
  As a visitor of Pixelated
  I want to sign up
  So I can log in to my account and see the welcome email

  Scenario: Visitor creates his account
    Given a user is accessing the signup page
    When I enter username, password and password confirmation
    And I click on the signup button
    Then I should see the user control panel

  Scenario: Existing user logs into his account
    Given a user is accessing the login page
    When I enter username and password as credentials
    And I click on the login button
    Then I should see the fancy interstitial
    Then I have mails
    When I logout
    Then I should see the login page

  Scenario: Existing user logs in and logs out from the header
    Given a user is accessing the login page
    When I enter username and password as credentials
    And I click on the login button
    Then I should see the fancy interstitial
    Given I go to the backup account page
    When I logout from the header

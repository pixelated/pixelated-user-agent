Pixelated User Agent
====================

This contains the Pixelated User Agent, which is composed of a web UI written as a JavaScript single page app, and a service that provides a REST-ful interface that the UI can use for all User Agent actions. For now, all of these actions are mail-related but this might evolve later. The default service is written to talk to a Pixelated or LEAP provider.

>**The Pixelated User Agent is still in early development state!**

>Some things may not yet work the way you expect it to.
>Setting up the service (as opposed to the fake service or inbox-app) is still rather troublesome and so far it only serves limited functionality.



# Running it
The User Agent is composed of 2 components:
- The Web Ui, which is the the HTML, CSS and JS files served to the browser; and
- The Service component, which is the web service that serves the Web Ui to the browser, provides the REST API which the the Web Ui uses, and integrates with the LEAP or Pixelated provider.

## Quickstart

Dependencies are: node, npm, ruby, bundle, virtualenv, git

On Debian/Ubuntu systems you need:

    sudo apt-get install nodejs npm ruby bundler virtualenv git

Once you have that, run:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pixelated-project/pixelated-user-agent/master/install-pixelated.sh | /bin/bash
```

## Web Ui
The Web Ui needs to generate the templates and CSS to be served. For that, you need (from inside `./web-ui`) to run the command `./go build` at least once after downloading the code. From here on, you can run `./go watch` to auto-generate the resources as they are changed.

## Service

## Fake Service
This is a Fake Service used for testing the Web Ui. It works as the real service, but mocking the connection to the LEAP/Pixelated provider with a predefined dataset of emails.

To run the Fake Service, run the command `./go server:start` on the terminal. `./go server:restart` restarts the service.

# Setting things up
Before being able to run the Service (the Fake or real), you must first set this components up by installing their dependencies.

## Web Ui
From inside `./web-ui`:
```
$ bundle install
$ npm install
$ bower install
```
If you don't have `bower` installed globaly, change the third line to `$ ./node_modules/bower/bin/bower install`

## Service

## Fake Service
From inside `./fake-service`
```
$ virtualenv .virtualenv
$ source .virtualenv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ ./go
```

If you want to see random emails on the fake service, run it like this
```
$ env AUTOLOAD=True ./go
```

If you want to control the emails you'll see on the fake service, edit the mailset.csv.example file
and run the following command while the server is running
```
$ curl --data-binary @mailset.csv.example http://localhost:4567/control/mailset/csv/load
```


And that's it.
